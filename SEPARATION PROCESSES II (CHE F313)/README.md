### `Notes/` — written here

- `SP2-notes.tex` — short notes + formula sheet, covering **all 14 lecture decks**: Module 1
  Lectures 1–6 and Module 2 Lectures 1–8. Definitions, the derivation steps (including the
  hand-worked Lecture 3, Lecture 5 and Mod 2 Lecture 1 derivations), every formula on the
  slides, and the practice problems.
  **This is the canonical standard** for notes structure, style and depth across the whole
  repository; the other subjects' notes are built to match it. It is written for XeLaTeX with a
  full TeX Live (`xcolor`, `tcolorbox`, `siunitx`, `booktabs`, `enumitem`, `mathtools`, `multirow`).
- `SP2-Short-Notes-and-Formula-Sheet.tex` — the same document **ported to the base TeX tree**, so
  it rebuilds with `tools/latex` like every other subject's notes. Produced by
  `tools/latex/port.py` from `SP2-notes.tex`; edit `SP2-notes.tex` and re-port rather
  than editing this file. Verified equivalent: rebuilding through `tools/latex/gen.py`
  reproduces the committed PDF word for word (25 pp, 0 errors, 0 overfull).
  (The standalone file briefly carried a generator regression — `port.py` dropped the
  `\begin{document}` line; fixed 20-09-2026, and the file now also compiles on its own:
  25 pp, 0 errors, 0 overfull.)
- `SP2-Short-Notes-and-Formula-Sheet.pdf` — 25-page A4 PDF.
- `SP2-Problems-and-Solutions.tex` — **every numerical question in the uploaded slides, tutorials,
  tests and `Problems.pptx`, with its solution** (Q1–Q15, each followed by its `Ans` block,
  segregated by source; Part D holds the Module 2 / `Problems.pptx` problems Q12–Q15).
- `SP2-Problems-and-Solutions.pdf` — 16-page A4 PDF compiled from `SP2-Problems-and-Solutions.tex`.
- `sp2-sizing-curves.png` — the differential and cumulative size-distribution figure used by Q6,
  plotted here from the sieve table printed on `Tutorials/Tutorial 3.pptx` slide 2.
- `sp2-answers-check.py` — the arithmetic record. Reproduces every derived number in the solutions
  document, in the same order; stdlib-only, run `python3 sp2-answers-check.py`.

Rebuild either PDF after editing its `.tex` with any LaTeX distribution, e.g.
`tectonic SP2-Problems-and-Solutions.tex` or `latexmk -xelatex SP2-notes.tex`. Packages used:
`geometry`, `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `mathtools`, `xcolor`, `booktabs`, `tabularx`, `array`, `multirow`,
`enumitem`, `fancyhdr`, `tcolorbox` (`breakable,skins`), `siunitx`, `hyperref`.

**Both documents are LaTeX in, PDF out. Keep the `.tex` whenever the PDF is edited or replaced** —
the `.tex` is the editable copy; the PDF is a build product.

## Source and delivered files (the rule)

Everything in this repository is one of two kinds:

- **Source** — the files as uploaded by the course: all of `Slides/`, `Tutorials/` and `Tests/`.
  These are the source of truth. Question text, given data, notation, formulas and the **method of
  solution** all come from them.
- **Delivered** — the files created here: `Notes/SP2-notes.tex`, `Notes/SP2-Problems-and-Solutions.tex`,
  their PDFs, the figure `sp2-sizing-curves.png`, the checker `sp2-answers-check.py`, and this README.
  They are derived work.

Rules that follow:

1. **Nothing delivered is presented as source.** A question is quoted from the source; the solution is
   worked only with the method taught in that source, and each question names the slide, tutorial or
   test it comes from.
2. **No outside method.** Where a source gives a particular route (e.g. Rittinger rather than Bond, the
   slide's own form of the mixing-index variance), that route is used, even when another textbook
   method would also work.
3. **Every derived number is reproducible**: run `python3 sp2-answers-check.py` and compare.
4. **Where the source is silent or self-inconsistent, say so** — do not fill the gap with a guessed
   number. Two examples in the solutions document: the volume shape factor `a` is not given in Q1
   (the answer is written as a function of `a`, with the values for the common choices shown), and the
   shape factor / sphericity data of Q7 do not agree among themselves whichever shape factor is
   assumed (`Φ_s > 1`, impossible) — the document reports the formula result and says why.
5. Answers are reported to the precision the input data supports, with the unrounded value shown where
   that is useful.

### Practice problems collected in the notes

The five practice problems printed in `Notes/SP2-notes.tex` are Q1–Q5 above; the questions documents
solves them, the notes state them.

### Slides checked and carrying no question

Mod 1 Lec 5 slides 7–18, Mod 1 Lec 3 slides 3–8, Mod 2 Lec 1 slides 11–15 (hand-written derivations,
no question posed); Mod 1 Lec 1 slides 11/18 and Mod 2 Lec 2 slide 16 (conceptual text only); slides
that merely link demonstration videos or show data tables, diagrams and graphs. No question was
invented to fill the list, and no slide, tutorial or test that poses a question was left out.
